## Goal:
- Reach or go over 21.md

## Rules
1. All groups start with 1.md
2. Once you have an answer, put your answer in a text file with the following format: \<groupName\>_\<number\>.txt. Push your work onto Github inside the 'submissions' folder
3. You will answer questions based off your win streak. Ex) If you have answered 2 questions in a row successfully (without retries), then you get to skip 2 questions and answer the 3rd down.

Ex) 
- Group1 answers question 6) (has a streak of 3)
- Creates a file called Group1_6.txt with their solution to question 6) under the submissions folder
- Adds the file to git via `git add -A`
- Commits the change via `git commit -m "<msg>"`
- Pushes the changes onto master
- SI Leader approves changes (or not) verbally
- If changes are approved, Group1 advances to question 11) (skip 7, 8, 9, 10) because they have a streak of 4 now

    Note to SI Leaders: Make sure to fork the repo, don't add collabs to original
